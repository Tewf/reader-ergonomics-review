# Contributing to this repository

For anyone changing this repository, person or language model. To apply the reader-ergonomics standard elsewhere,
read its [standard.md](https://github.com/Tewf/reader-ergonomics/blob/4f99372093729dacf982e9174e94f6b8793c513d/standard.md); this file is about this repository only.

## Before writing

1. Read the standard at the release this repository checks against (v1.20.0), and the front page's scope: what is in,
   what is out, and which neighbour holds what is out.
2. The first job is the review on the front page, in its five steps, staged outside this repository until it names its
   baseline; it is finished when it can. The repository may be renamed at the frame step.
3. A fact that belongs to a neighbour is linked, never copied. A choice that shapes the repository gets a record in
   [decisions/](decisions/).

## Rules for claims

- Every claim carries a grade: **measured**, **supported with caveat**, **convention** or **not supported**. A grade
  moves only with a cited source.
- Cite as `Author Year`; the entry goes once into `evidence/bibliography.md` when the review starts, with a DOI, an
  arXiv id or a stable URL. A key names one work across the family (reader-ergonomics decision 0003): the family is
  listed under `[bibliography_keys]` in checks/config.toml.
- Evidence against a rule goes into the review's `against.md`, never deleted to make a rule look stronger.
- A number read in a summary rather than in the source is marked "(secondary)".

## The model's place

- A model explains, proposes, translates and drafts; it decides nothing. Its output is checked by a program or read
  by the maintainer.

## Links

- Down to reader-ergonomics: pinned to the release's commit, as CI is.
- Up: none.

## Before handing back

Run the checks against the release CI uses, extracted inside this repository, in `checks/out/standard`, which git and
the checks both skip:

```sh
rm -rf checks/out/standard && mkdir -p checks/out/standard
git -C ../reader-ergonomics archive 4f99372 | tar -x -C checks/out/standard   # the commit checks.yml pins
python3 checks/out/standard/checks/run.py . --tiers program,meaning --judge flag   # the repository, as CI runs it
```

- Fix every error. Read every warning.
- Answer the questions in `checks/out/needs-judgment.md` in `checks/judgments.toml`, each answer quoting in backticks
  a word or heading of its own file.
- Keep [llms.txt](llms.txt), [README.md](README.md) and [README.fr.md](README.fr.md) in step.
- A pin raise goes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), not in decisions/.

## House conventions

- No em dash or en dash in prose; use a comma, a colon, parentheses, or a hyphen for ranges.
- Commit messages follow the standard's commit shape: a subject of at most 72 characters, then why.
- The maintainer decides every push.
